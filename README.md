Includes a simple launcher and an easy to use framework to make new games.

Install Games Pit in your Raspberry Pi and let your kids have fun with a remote mouse or keyboard.

QUICK INSTALL
=============

* You will need:

  * A computer with linux: a Raspberry Pi, a netbook. A screen is useful to enjoy all the features :-)
  * Python 2.7
  * Pygame libraries

* Install pygame if it is not already in your system (apt-get install python-pygame)

* Download Games-Pit https://github.com/alfem/gamespit/archive/master.zip

* Uncompress the zip file in your home directory. Now you have got a "gamespit" directory.

* Edit gamespit.conf (in gamespit directory) to set the games full screen and deactivating debug mode (I use to upload it with these settings on)

* Get into Games-Pit directory and run "./gamespit" 

* Quit Games-Pit main menu pressing "Left Control + ESC" (child-proof)
